MOCK EXAM 1
==========================

To help you prepare for the exam practical, let's do a mock exam. These are the types of questions I will ask you during the exam. I will give you points for each section, with the idea that I have to help you get past a particular section, you lose those points, but if you can do the rest of the steps, you can still get credit for that.



1. Launch a medium instance.  _______ 5 points



2. Update your machine and install the software using ``apt-get``. _________ 5 points



3. Install HMMER using Conda, and download `uniprot_sprot.fasta.gz` like you did in the hmmer lab. Download the file `ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/Pfam/current_release/Pfam-A.hmm.gz` and prepare it using the command `gzip -d Pfam-A.hmm.gz; hmmpress Pfam-A.hmm` ___________________ 10 points.



4. Download the dataset located here: ``https://s3.amazonaws.com/gen711/test.dataset.fa``. The dataset you will use in ``hmmsearch`` is called ``test.dataset.fa``.  _________________ 5 points



5. Start ``hmmsearch`` like we did in the hmmer lab.  ____________________ 10 points (``hmmsearch`` should run for <10 minutes.)



6. How many ``4HBT`` domains are present in the dataset? _______________ 15 points

(Note that you have less work here, relative to what you did in the lab. AKA, you did more and different things there)

Lecture 1
- What is genomics and bioinformatics?
- Tools needed for applied bioinformatics.

Lecture 2
- Sequencing platforms
    - Input: DNA from one or many samples that have been amplified
    - Output: a FASTQ files (file of reads)
    - Why do they differ?
    - How do they differ?
- fastq files
    - What does the quality score for a given base tell you

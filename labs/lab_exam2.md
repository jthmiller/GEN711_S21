Exam 2
--

1. Launch a m1.xlarge instance.  _______ 2 points


2. Update your machine and install the basic software using ``apt-get`` as per the genome assembly lab. _________ 2 points



3. Install `Linuxbrew` and the software as per the genome assembly lab ___________________ 2 points.


4. Download some data _________ 2 points

5. Assembly the Illumina data using the `pe` (paired-end) data you just downloaded, using SPAdes and 2 different kmers. Use kmers of length `55` and `85`. Hint, in the lab we used mate pair data, designated by `mp1-1` and `mp1-2`. You do NOT need those parts of the command. Assemblies should take about 12 minutes. ___________________ 4 points

6. Using quast, evaluate the assembled genomes in `k55/scaffolds.fasta` and `k85/scaffolds.fasta` and the reference genome you downloaded above (about 11 minutes). Using the `report.txt` file, just like you did in the lab. Which assembly is better and why? Note, there might be more than 1 right answer, so the justification is very important. ___________________ 8 points

# Terminate your instance!!
